# Spotify-Dashboard
 The Spotify Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project that allows you to explore and analyze music streaming data. It was created as part of the DataDNA Competition Challenge hosted by Onyx Data. This dashboard provides insights into the top-streamed songs, artists, and release dates based on your preferences.
